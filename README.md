Torque-Limited-Pendulum
=======================

A simple pendulum starts from a state of rest (equilibrium). This pendulum has to become vertically inverted and stay at this ‘goal state’ for an extended period of time. The pendulum is given a periodic torque at every time interval to achieve this goal.
